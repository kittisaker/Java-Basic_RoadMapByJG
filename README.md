# Java Programming Language : Chapter 6 Arithmetic Operators in Java with Examples

## 1. The Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.

## 2. The Basic Arithmetic Operators
The basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — all behave as you would expect for all numeric types. The unary minus operator negates its single operand.

## 3. The Modulus Operator
The modulus operator, %, returns the remainder of a division operation. It can be applied to floating-point types as well as integer types. 

## 4. Arithmetic Compound Assignment Operators
Java provides special operators that can be used to combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment.

```java
a = a + 4;

a += 4;
```

## 5. Increment and Decrement
The ++ and – – are Java’s increment and decrement operators.
The increment operator increases its operand by one. 

```java
x = x + 1;
//or
x++;
```
