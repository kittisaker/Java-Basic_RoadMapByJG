# Java Programming Language : Chapter 9 Java Access Modifiers - Public, Private, Protected & Default

## 1. Private Access Modifier
A private class member cannot be accessed from outside the class; only members of the same class can access these private members.
* A class cannot be a private except inner classes because inner classes are nothing but again members of the outer class. So members of a class (field, method, constructor, and inner class) can be private but not the class itself.
* We canâ€™t create subclasses to that class which has only private constructors.

## 2. Default Access Modifier (no access modifier specified)
When we do not mention any access modifier, it is called the default access modifier. The scope of this modifier is limited to the package only. This means that if we have a class with the default access modifier in a package, only those classes that are in this package can access this class. No other class outside this package can access this class. Similarly, if we have a default method or data member in a class, it would not be visible in the class of another package.

## 3. Protected Access Modifier
If a class or its members are declared as protected are only accessible by the classes of the same package and the subclasses present in any package. You can also say that the protected access modifier is similar to the default access modifier with one exception that it has visibility in subclasses.
Classes cannot be declared protected. This access modifier is generally used in a parent-child relationship.

## 4. Public Access Modifier
If a class or its members are declared as public, they can be accessed from any other class regardless of the package boundary. It is comparable to a public place in the real world, such as a company cafeteria that all employees can use irrespective of their department.
